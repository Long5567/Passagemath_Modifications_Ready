# Contributing to passagemath #

passagemath is a fork of SageMath. It is intended to merge new releases
of SageMath into passagemath on a regular basis.

For now, direct code contributions to passagemath are limited to changes
that support the goals of the fork outlined in [README.md](README.md).
All other changes should be submitted to the SageMath project.
